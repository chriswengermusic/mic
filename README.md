# mic

Hello world for HTML5 mic input.  Based on code from:

-   <https://github.com/cwilso/pitchdetect>
-   <https://github.com/mdn/voice-change-o-matic>

Works on chrome (chromium 42 on debian) if run from a (local)
web server.  Doesn't work as file:///...

Works for a little while on firefox (iceweasel 31 on debian)
but then mic input seems to drift to a stable position and
just stay there.
